# YOU'LL COWARDS DON'T EVEN SMOKE CRACK

HAHA, here's a little something for you busters, yeah<br/>

What's up with that?<br/>
Yall cowards don't even smoke crack<br/>

Hater, you don't even smoke crack, bitch, you's a mark fool<br/>
Motherfuck that ho shit, that's a G, that's him<br/>
I'm about to blaze up, 'specially when it's after dinner<br/>
I changed the game don't get it misunderstood<br/>
Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good<br/>
Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick<br/>
Laws know I keep it, they on my dick, these niggas sick<br/>
But when I do smoke some weed<br/>
I'm straight out that rose, you best believe<br/>
But green ain't better than that hard, hard is so much fun<br/>
Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done<br/>
And I don't care if you judge me<br/>
I'm smoking cooked, and living so lovely<br/>
So stop looking like you're dumb<br/>
You know you wanna try, but fail to get some<br/>

It's on if I feel [?]<br/>
I'm blazing white, now my destiny ain't stopping<br/>
I'm coming up in a song to rap<br/>
I sold my soul to satan but bought it back from God with this song<br/>
Y'all bustas ain't ballin<br/>
Until you smoke some work and see who really paper calling<br/>
Y'all falling off like the last century<br/>
No respect from me till you get that cheese<br/>
And you see what life is all about<br/>
Till then you just a little bitch with a raised snout<br/>
I gets my clout from the mainstream<br/>
It's always love and dap in my dope scene<br/>
I'm clowning, and keeping it rock<br/>
My coke chopped and screwed cause I'm on the block<br/>
I'm stinging big and bringing work<br/>
All the while keeping y'all haters feelings hurt<br/>
